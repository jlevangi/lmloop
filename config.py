"""Configuration: a global TOML file, overridden per repository.

The predecessor reads one global config and nothing else, which is why its dashboard has to
rewrite ``~/.predecessor/config.yml`` in place just to choose a model for a run.  A
project-local file removes that whole class of hack: per-repo gate commands and
worktree placement live with the repo they describe.

## Why TOML and not YAML

Asked for as `config.yaml`, and answered no, deliberately.  Python's standard
library reads TOML (`tomllib`, 3.11+) and does not read YAML.  The ways out were:
add PyYAML as a dependency, keep TOML, or accept YAML only when PyYAML happens
to be installed.

TOML, because the alternatives cost more than the syntax is worth.  A dependency
would end "standard library only, no build step", which is what lets this be
installed by cloning it and is why a run can start on a machine that has nothing
but Python.  Optional YAML is worse than either: the same file would be read on
one machine and rejected on another, and the failure would arrive as a config
that silently does not exist.  Hand-writing a parser is not on the table -- YAML
has enough edges that a partial one is a liability, and this file would own it
forever.

The gap is small for ten sections of scalars, and TOML's `[section]` maps
exactly onto the shape below.  Worth revisiting if lmloop ever grows a
dependency for another reason; not worth acquiring one for this.

## Compatibility

A config written before a rename keeps working, and the renames so far are
handled in place rather than by a version number:

* `[stop] max_iterations` sets both `initial_turns` and `hard_turn_ceiling`,
  and an explicit new key wins over it.  Translated in `load`, and still a
  valid setting as far as `validate` is concerned -- legacy is not wrong.
* `[models] local_provider` (a string) is read as a one-item `local_providers`;
  see `models.local_providers`.

No `schema_version` here, deliberately, unlike `runrecord.py` -- that one is a
contract between two *programs* that must agree about files on disk, where a
version is what lets a reader refuse politely.  This is a file a person writes,
where a rename is better absorbed than announced.  Add one if a change ever
cannot be: the shim goes in `load`, and `validate` keeps accepting the old
spelling so nobody is told their working config is a mistake.
