/* Caches the shell so the app opens instantly and survives a dead network.
 * Never caches data.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole design. Every byte under /api/ is a run's
 * present state, and a cached answer to "is it still alive" is worse than no
 * answer -- so API requests are network-only and fail loudly. The shell is the
 * opposite: it changes when the app is deployed and never otherwise, so it is
 * served from cache and refreshed in the background.
 *
 * Bump SHELL when the shell files change; the activate handler drops every
 * other cache, which is also how this origin's previous occupant (predecessor-dashboard,
 * which cached an app shell AND intercepted fetches) gets evicted from phones
 * that still have it installed.
